In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree
Where Alph, the sacred river ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.
And twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round
And here were gardens ancient as the hills
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree
And there were forests ancient as the hills
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
...?

A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw
She was an Abyssinian maid,
And on her dulcimer she played
Singing of mount Abora.
Could I revive within me
That symphony and song
To such a deep delight 'twould win me
That with music loud and long
I would sing that song of air
That sunny dome, those caves of ice
And all who heard would see me there
And all would cry, "Beware, beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice
And close your eyes with holy dread
For he on honeydew hath fed
And drunk the milk of Paradise!"
