In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome secree
Where Alph, the sacred river ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea
And twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round
And there were gardens ancient as the hills
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree
And here were forests ancient as the hills
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw
She was an Abyssinian maid
And on her dulcimer she played
Singing of mount Abora
Could I revive within me
That symphony and song
To such a deep delight 'twould win me
That with music loud and long
I would sing that...
That ..., those caves of ice
And all who looked would see me there
And all would cry, "Beware, beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle round him thrice
And close your eyes with holy dread
For he on honeydew hath fed
And drunk the milk of Paradise!"
