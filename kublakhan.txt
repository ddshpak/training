In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome secree
Where Alph, the sacred river ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea
And twice five miles of fertile ground
With walls and towers were girdled round
And there were gardens ancient as the hills
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree
And here were forests ancient as the hills
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw
She was an Abyssinian maid
And on her dulcimer she played
Singing of mount Abora

And all who looked would see me there
And all would cry, "Beware, beware!
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
Weave a circle twice him round
For he on honeydew hath fed
