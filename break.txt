Break, break, break
On the cold grey shores, o sea
And I would that my heart could utter
The thoughts that arise in me

Oh, well for the fisherman's boy
That shouts with his sister at play
Oh, well for the sailor lad
Who sings in his boat on the bay

And the stately ships go on
To their haven under the hill
...?
...?

Break, break, break
At the foot of he crags, o sea
But the tender touch of a day that is dead
Will never arise in me
