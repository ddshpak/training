'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
'Twas mimsy, and the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe.

Beware the Jabberwock, my son
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch
Beware the Jub-Jub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch

He took his vorpal blade in hand
Long time his manxome foe he sought
Then rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood a while in thought

And while in uffish thought he stoop
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame
Came whifflng through the tulgey wood
And burbled as it came.

One two! One two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack
He left it dead, and with its head
He went gallumphing back

"And hast though slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
He chortled in his joy.
